# Introduction

I am excited to share my experience as a DevOps Technician at Vezzor, where I worked with various AWS services, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Docker Compose, website migrations, buildpacks, and the 12-factor methodology for web applications. In this post, I will provide a detailed overview of my role and responsibilities and how I leveraged my technical skills to deliver high-quality solutions.

## AWS Services

I had the opportunity to work with several AWS services, including EC2, S3, and RDS. I was responsible for the infrastructure management of a few web applications, and I used AWS to ensure that the applications were always available and performing optimally. I also worked on automating deployment and scaling processes, which helped us save time and increase efficiency.

## GitHub

GitHub was one of the key tools that I used at Vezzor. I utilized GitHub for version control and collaborated with the development team to ensure that code changes were properly tracked and managed. I also implemented various Git workflows and strategies to ensure that code changes were delivered in a timely and efficient manner.

## Linux

I had a lot of experience working with Linux at Vezzor. I was responsible for managing the Linux servers that hosted our web applications and ensured that they were always up-to-date and secure. I also worked on optimizing the performance of the servers, which helped us deliver fast and responsive web applications to our users.

## Docker and Docker Compose

Docker and Docker Compose were two of the key technologies that I used at Vezzor. I leveraged Docker to create isolated environments for our web applications, which made it easier to manage dependencies and ensure that the applications were portable. I also used Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container applications, which allowed us to simplify the deployment process and increase efficiency.

## Website Migrations

At Vezzor, I was responsible for migrating several websites to new servers and platforms. I worked with the development team to ensure that the migrations were seamless and that the websites were fully functional after the migrations. I also implemented various strategies to ensure that the migrations were performed with minimal downtime.

## Buildpacks

I had some experience working with buildpacks at Vezzor. I used buildpacks to automate the deployment of web applications and ensure that they were delivered in a consistent and reliable manner. I also worked on improving the build processes and automating various tasks, which helped us save time and increase efficiency.

## The 12-Factor Methodology for Web Applications

The 12-factor methodology for web applications was a key concept that I learned at Vezzor. I used this methodology to design and develop web applications that were scalable, maintainable, and resilient. I also worked on implementing the 12-factor principles in our existing web applications, which helped us improve their performance and reliability.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, my experience as a DevOps Technician at Vezzor was an incredible learning opportunity. I had the chance to work with a talented and dedicated team, and I was able to leverage my technical skills to deliver high-quality solutions. I am grateful for the experience and the lessons that I learned, and I am eager to continue my growth as a DevOps professional.

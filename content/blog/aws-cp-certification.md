# My Preparation Strategy

For preparation, I have watched the [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/) available on [AWS Classroom Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/). Once I was done with the course, I did the practice tests on [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/).

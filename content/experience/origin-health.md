## Description

**Guide:** **Dr. Sripad Krishna Devalla** (co-founder and CTO at OriginHealth)

I worked as a remote intern at [**OriginHealth Pte. Ltd.**](https://www.originhealth.ai/) (Singapore), where the company envisions to automate the detection of **birth defects** from **fetal ultrasound scans**, a procedure that demands expertise in **radiology**. 

Here, I developed a configuration-driven framework with data preprocessing pipeline to train deep learning models on **AWS EC2** instances. The framework standardized the training procedure for ML models and **saved more than 100 hours of development time for the ML team**. I also worked on fetal head segmentation using this framework. 

This opportunity provided me with a deeper insight into the applications of AI and Computer Vision in medical diagnosis and taught me to work with little and sensitive data. In addition, **Confluence** was used for documentation and **Jira Software** was used for **Agile Software Development**.

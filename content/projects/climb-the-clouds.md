# Introduction
As a DevOps technician at Veezor, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects. In this post, I will discuss three projects that I worked on, detailing the technologies used and the role I played in each project.

## Migration to AWS Services of a Major Merger & Acquisitions Portal in Brazil
The first project involved the migration of a major mergers and acquisitions portal in Brazil, [Fusões e Aquisições](fusoesaquisicoes.com), to AWS services. In this project, we applied the 12 factors and used various technologies such as Docker Compose, Maestro, GitHub, CloudFormation, CodeBuild, Cloudflare, and others.

As a DevOps technician, my role in this project was to assist with the setup and configuration of the AWS infrastructure, including the creation of CloudFormation templates, the setup of CodeBuild projects, and the configuration of Cloudflare for DNS and SSL. I also worked on the Dockerization of the application and its deployment to AWS ECS.

# Modernization and Migration of EST3 Soccer Statistics
The second project involved the modernization and migration of [EST3 Soccer Statistics](https://realtimesports.com.br/mngr/index.php). In this project, we updated the middleman, order, and calculations. We also used the role in IAM to store data in the S3 bucket.

As a DevOps technician, my role in this project was to set up the infrastructure for the application, including the creation of an S3 bucket and the configuration of IAM roles. I also worked on the deployment of the application using Lambda functions in JavaScript and various AWS services such as Lambda, S3, and Cloudflare.

# Deployment of the 2022 Brazilian Elections Dashboard
The third project involved the deployment of the 2022 Brazilian Elections Dashboard in several news sites, including [assets.divulgaeleicoes.com.br/widget1/](assets.divulgaeleicoes.com.br/widget1/). In this project, we used Middleman to create static pages and updated the middleman, order, and calculations.

As a DevOps technician, my role in this project was to set up the AWS infrastructure for the application, including the creation of an S3 bucket and the configuration of IAM roles. I also worked on the deployment of the application using Lambda functions in JavaScript and various AWS services such as Lambda, S3, and Cloudflare.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, working on these three projects has been an excellent learning experience for me as a DevOps technician. Deploying and managing applications using AWS services, Docker Compose, CloudFormation, and other technologies has allowed me to gain valuable experience and skills. I look forward to working on more exciting projects and learning new technologies in the future.

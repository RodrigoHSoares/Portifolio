### Description

- Developed an event-driven serverless integration framework using AWS services like **AppFlow**, **S3**, **Lambda** and **EventBridge**, to sync customer data between Salesforce and BuyerAssist. Through this, I learned to build systems to support bi-directional sync of large volumes of data from multiple sources, perform **CRUD** operations on **MongoDB** as well as **schema design**.
- Developed a configuration-driven framework to extend the pattern matching capability of **AWS EventBridge**, which **prevented thousands of false invocations of AWS Lambda functions**.
- Implemented a system to track asynchronous data transfer jobs through AWS AppFlow, which **saved hours of debugging time**.
- Developed a **Salesforce app** using SFDX to provide clients with a customized experience within their Salesforce dashboard.
- Developed a **Slack bot** to send interactive daily notifications to customers, and to allow them to take actions directly from Slack. This eliminated the operational resistance and **increased the adoption of our product by over 50%**.
- Implemented authorization for Slack integration with BuyerAssist using **React** and **OAuth 2.0**
- Mentored a new recruit for a period of 1 month

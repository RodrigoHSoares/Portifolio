## Description

As a DevOps Technician at Veezor, I had the opportunity to work with a range of cutting-edge technologies and tools. My primary focus was on AWS services, infrastructure management, and migration processes. Here are some examples of tasks I performed during my time at Veezor:

-**AWS Services Management:** I was responsible for managing and maintaining various AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, and ELB. This involved monitoring the performance of these services, troubleshooting issues, and making updates and optimizations as needed.

-**Infrastructure Migration:** I worked on several migration projects that involved moving the existing infrastructure to AWS. This involved creating and executing a migration plan, testing the new infrastructure, and ensuring a smooth transition for users.

-**Docker Deployment:** I played a key role in the deployment of Docker containers for various applications. This involved setting up a Docker infrastructure, automating the deployment process, and monitoring the containers to ensure optimal performance.

-**Infrastructure Automation:** I worked on automating various infrastructure-related tasks using tools like Ansible and Terraform. This included creating scripts to automate the deployment of new resources, updating existing resources, and performing routine maintenance tasks.

-**Monitoring and Log Management:** I was responsible for setting up and maintaining a comprehensive monitoring and log management system. This involved configuring tools like CloudWatch and ELK to collect and analyze logs, set up alerts, and provide visibility into the infrastructure.

Overall, my experience at Veezor was a challenging and rewarding one. I was able to expand my skillset and gain valuable hands-on experience with AWS and other DevOps technologies.
